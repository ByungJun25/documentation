# Configuring administrator roles

Administrators are the users of the admin panel of a Strapi application. They accounts as well as the roles they are attributed are managed through the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature, which settings are in the *Administration panel* area of the settings interface, accessible from *General > Settings* in the main navigation of the admin panel.

By default, 3 administrator roles are defined for any Strapi application:

- Author, to be able to create, manage and publish their own content.
- Editor, to be able to create content, and manage and publish any content.
- Super Admin, to be able to access all features and settings. This is the role attributed by default to the first administrator at the creation of the Strapi application.

::: warning ATTENTION
If you use your Strapi application with the Community Edition (see Pricing & Plans), your use of the RBAC feature will contain some limitations. Only the 3 default role are available, as you cannot create more roles and cannot delete the default ones. It is however possible to edit them, to an extent:

- Configuring permissions in detail is only available for the Enterprise Edition: with the Community Editio, if you have access to a content type, it is automatically a full access with all permissions.
- You can only configure permissions for the content types, but not for the plugins and settings of the Strapi application.
- Custom conditions defined for a specific permission are also only available for the Enterprise Edition.
